# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

I am planning a series of projects to push my understanding and capabilities of programming. The first of these is a simple program to mark the beginning and reiterate the basics as I am learning.

{Provide a description of your software}

My software is a single Python file which displays the text "Hello World" to the console.

{Describe your purpose for creating this software.}

My purpose for this software was to demonstate the very fundamentals of Python and also to mark the beginning of a series. As is tradition for engineers, the first endeavor displays a "Hello World" message.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

{Describe the tools that you used to develop the software}

The primary tools I used to develop the software were the Python language and the Visual Studio Code Editor. Visual Studio Code (VSCode) enabled me to write the code in correct Python syntax and to easily create a repository to host my project on the web.

I used GitHub in the development of this software, to aid in proper version control.

{Describe the programming language that you used}

I used Python to create my software. Python is a high-level programming language. It's one of the most common languages for programmers to use, in part because the syntax is very easy to learn.

Because of Python's structure, it is not always considered the most secure in terms of programming languages. This is in large because it doesn't require a distinction between private and public classes, methods, and variables. In large projects, measures can be taken to improve the security and integrity of code using Python.

Fortunately, Python fit the needs of my current software perfectly. It was efficient and took only one line of code to accomplish my goal.
